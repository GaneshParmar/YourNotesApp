# My Notes Application

This is a simple notes application that allows you to create, view, update, and delete notes. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage your personal or professional notes efficiently.

## Features

- View all notes: The main screen displays a list of all the notes you have created. Each note is shown with its title and description.
- Search functionality: A search bar at the top of the main screen allows you to search for specific notes based on their titles or descriptions.
- Update notes: By clicking on any note, you can access the update note page, where you can modify the title and description of the note.
- Delete notes: Long-pressing on a note triggers a delete confirmation pop-up. Once confirmed, the note is permanently deleted.
- Add new notes: A floating action button with a "+" sign allows you to add new notes. Clicking on it opens a screen where you can enter the title and description of the note.
- Persistent storage: All notes are stored using Room Database, ensuring data persistence across application launches.
- LiveData integration: The application utilizes LiveData, which provides real-time updates of the notes list whenever changes occur.

## Installation

To install and run the application locally, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/notes-app.git
```

2. Open Android Studio.

3. Select "Open an existing Android Studio project" and navigate to the cloned repository.

6. Run the application by clicking on the "Run" button in Android Studio or by using the shortcut Shift + F10.

7. The application should now be installed and running on your device or emulator.

## Dependencies

The application relies on the following dependencies:

- LiveData: A data holder class that allows data observation within the app's components.
- Room Database: A persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow more robust database access.
- RecyclerView: A flexible view for providing a limited window into a large data set, used to display the list of notes.
- StaggeredLayoutManager: A layout manager for RecyclerView that arranges items in a staggered grid pattern.

These dependencies are automatically resolved when building the project with Gradle.
